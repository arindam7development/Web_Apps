I have created two user interfaces, one is a newspaper article. In the newspaper one I have made a webpage just like a newspaper using bootstrap-3.1.1 and jquery-2.1.0.min.js.I have used only 5 cols instead of 12.

The second one is Shopping cart user interface . In this user will see a complete list of book, then user can drag and drop that particular book into the cart.
In this I have used jquery-ui-1.10.4.custom.css and jquery-ui-1.10.4.custom.js.
